Files Experiment01-Experiment28 are for the larger disk whose geometry can be found in "LargerDiskSurface.dat" file (this file is normalised by radius which in these experiments was 12mm).
Files SmallerDiskExperiment01-03 are for the smaller disk whose geometry can be found in "SmallerDiskSurface.dat" file (also normalised by radius which in this case was 5mm).

All of the files which contain "Experiment" in their filename have the following format:
Each row corresponds to one data point at a given instant in time.
The first column is time
Columns 2-4 are (x,y,z) of the position of the centre of mass. The centre of the coordinate system is at the centre of the tank at the top of the surface of the liquid. 
Columns 5-7
